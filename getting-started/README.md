This illustrate usage of [`spwrap`](https://github.com/mhewedy/spwrap) to call stored procedures written in MySQL.

This project has no dependencies but on `spwrap`.

The database scripts are from Java Tutorial web site (with modifications).

You need to have running MySQL Server to be able to use this example. (you many consider use docker)
