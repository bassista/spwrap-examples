This illustrate usage of [`spwrap`](https://github.com/mhewedy/spwrap) to call stored procedures written in MySQL.

This project uses spring-boot (using auto-mappers depending on spring-jdbc)

The database scripts are from Java Tutorial web site (with modifications).

You need to have running MySQL Server to be able to use this example. (you many consider use docker)
